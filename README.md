# C# Unit Test Examples

The purpose of this project is to create documentation around unit testing ASP.NET Core and Framework libraries. This library will use Moq framework to build our unit tests. Feel free to create a pull request if you have any suggestions on any or scenarios we could add to this library

#### What does this repo provide me?
A guide on how to use Moq with ASP.Net

#### How can I use this repo?
1. Clone the repo 
2. Try to run the application endpoints, you will quickly find that the application cannot connect to the database.
3. You can use the unit tests to verify your code actually works in isolation by mocking the data layer of your code

#### What is Moq?
Moq (pronounced "Mock-you" or just "Mock") is the only mocking library for .NET developed from scratch to take full advantage of .NET Linq expression trees and lambda expressions, which makes it the most productive, type-safe and refactoring-friendly mocking library available. And it supports mocking interfaces as well as classes. Its API is extremely simple and straightforward, and doesn't require any prior knowledge or experience with mocking concepts.


#### Scenarios:
Each folder contains a project with a test project explaining how we wrote the tests. All the examples are based on ASP.Net.
1. [ASP.NET Core Test](https://git.rockfin.com/QAPOW/CSharpUnitTestExamples/tree/master/AspNetCore) 
2. ASP.NET Framework Test (WIP)
